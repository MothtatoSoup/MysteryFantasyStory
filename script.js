To bad for him<br/><br/><br/>  You arrive at work. The silence buzzing louder than usual.<br/>  Normally there's the goblins at the front desk.<br/>but they aren't there<br/><br/> Normally there's the cleaner faries.<br/>But they aren't there<br/><br/>Obviously. They get upset with even the smallest speck of dust so why would they ever allow a stain on the floor.<br/><br/><br/> <br/> ...<br/><br/><br/><br/>  A Stain on the floor...?<br/><br/><br/><br/> Before you can even examine it...<br/><br/> A loud ringing feels your ears<br/><br/>The world starts to blur tog3tHer<br/><br/>Y0u g3t v3Ry dzsy<br/><br/> S3e m0v3MenT<br/><br/><br/> b3cOme v3Ry br1Ght<br/><br/> VeRy waRm<br/> <br/> <br/> f1R3 <br/> <br/> <br/> ENDING 1: DEATH BY FIRE<br/><br/><br/><br/> 1: Resart<br/> ","You decide to visit your old friend, and get something warm to drink.<br/><br/><br/> Agis was as kind as we was tall. <br/>  Always greeting you with a smile <br/> <br/> A smile that is strangely familiar? <br/> A weird sentiment to have when you visit your friend so often <br/> <br/> “Hey there detective!” The night elf greats <br/> You return it <br/> “What would you like? Your Usual: Coffee, <br/> or do you want to try something new? Like tea?” <em> <br/><br/><br/><br/>What would you like? <br/>1: You can’t go wrong with coffee <br/>2: Maybe you should mix it up? Tea sounds nice! <br/>","You decided to get something different today and Agis was happy to make you some of his famous tea! <br/><br/><br/> After getting the cup, you and Agis started chatting. Nothing too important, mostly about life and trivial things of the sort. <br/> You check the time... <br/> <br/> You’re Late!! <br/> <br/> You quickly take your tea and go, apologizing to Agis for cutting the conversation short. <br/> <br/> <br/> A few minutes later, you arrive at work. The silence buzzing louder than usual. <br/> Normally there's the goblins at the front desk. <br/>but they aren't there<br/><br/> Normally there's the cleaner Faries.<br/>But they aren't there<br/><br/>Obviously.

He suddenly remembers. <br/> “Oh! That’s right! Someone left a drink for you”<br/> Agis grabs a cup of coffee, now room temperature, and hands it to you <br/> <em> “I'll admit it was unusual, but they said they were friends of yours!” <<br/> <br/> “Do you know what they looked like?” <br/><br/>“Well.. No... They were... wearing a very large black hood...” <br/> <br/>Because you have such great instincts, you drank the coffee down in one gulp <br/> thinking nothing of how insanely suspicious it is for someone to make you a coffee. <br/><br/> Who isn’t Agis <br/><br/>Speaking of the elf,  “Oh, and someone left you note!” <em/> <br/>You take the note.. It reads: <br/> <br/><em> Hello detective!! Hope this tastes sweet >:3 <br/> <br/> <br/> Ps: If it wasn’t obvious this was poison and you’ll die in like 24 hours.<em/> <br/><br/>You gasp in surprise!! <br/><br/> *Gasp* <br/><br/> Agis looks at you worriedly <br/><em> Whats Wrong??<em/> <br/>You show him the note and he gasps in surprise too <br/> <br/>*Gasp* <br/> <br/> “Who would ever do this to you??” <br/> <br/>Then you think about how many people send you death threats on a daily basis. <br/> <br/>Alot of people actually. <br/>But you narrow it down to three <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> What lead do you follow? <br/> 1: Ever since High School, Hav has always had it out for you. <br/> You should investigate his fishing business <br/> 2: Itazura has always been a thorn in your back. <br/> She also happens to have her ears into everything. <br/> If she didn’t poison you, she might know who. <br/> 3: You do still need to pay your debt with Fotiá, maybe she got tired of waiting. ","You decide to visit Hav. He does send you the most death threats each month <br/><br/><br/> You make your way along the boardwalk until you see a small booth on the shore of the beach <br/>Accompanied by a very large Kraken, Hav <br/> <br/>You approach the booth titled ‘Hav’s Fishing’ to have a discussion with the myth himself <br/> He takes notice and... smiles...? <br/> <br/> I think... <br/> <br/> “Haven't seen you in a while Detective! High school, right?” <br/>You cut the pleasantries short and explain to Hav your situation <br/><br/>He looks taken aback <br/>  “What?? And you think it was me?? Why??” <br/> <br/> “You send me the most death threats out of anybody!!” <br/> <br/> “I forgot about that... <br/> See I had signed up for a Death Threat Subscription Service <br/> Basically you gave them an address, <br/> and they’d send a bunch of death threats. <br/>I should probably cancel that.. <br/>See, when we met, and when I signed up for that service, I was a troubled lad. <br/>Angsty too <br/>But I’m in a better place now! <br/>Also I can’t even fit through most doors, how would I have given that cuppa to your friend for you?” <br/> <br/>You hated to admit it, <br/>But you didn’t take into account Hav’s size. <br/> <br/>At least you eliminated a suspect! <br/>But.. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Who to find next? <br/> 1: Itazura <br/> 2: Fotiá ","You decide to seek out Itazura, the all-knowing Nogitsune. <br/>Who also happens to be your ex <br/><br/><br/> You arrive at Itazura’s secret base. <br/> Which is an abandoned building with his name in bright flashing neon lights. <br/> Quitley cracking open the door you see Itazura... <br/> Playing in a pile of gold... <br/>Gold he stole no doubt but you decide to ask him about it later <br/> You <em> very loudly <em/> open the door. <br/> <br/>Itazura doesn’t notice. <br/>Or he doesn’t care. <br/> <br/> You make your way to the pile of gold <br/> until you are standing right in front of it <br/> <br/>He still doesn’t care <br/> <br/> So you reach down to pick up a small golden coin- <br/> <br/> “Back off!!!” Itazura exclaims, finally acknowledging your own presence <br/> “Ugh. I know why you’re here... <br/> I was hoping that by ignoring you you’d leave <br/> but clearly you’re persistent” <br/> <br/> “So did you-” <br/> <br/> “No. I don’t need to poison you to get you out of my life <br/> You already walked out!” <br/> <br/> “I don’t want to talk about that <br/> I want to talk about if you know who poisoned me” <br/> <br/> “Yes.

I knew I was forgetting something!” <br/> “Listen... um that was a prank call?” <br/> <br/> ... <br/> <br/> “Okay fine!! We were planning to burn you alive...” <br/> <br/> “What about the poison?” <br/> <br/> “What poison?” <br/> <br/> “In my coffee at Agis’s Cafe...” <br/> <br/> “um.. Yeah... so ‘poison’ isn’t really what phoenixes do..” <br/> “we prefer to kill people as loud and destructive as possible” <br/> “Maybe explosions, guns and of course fires!” <br/> “But poison is a bit too quiet”<br/> <br/> you stare at the ground disappointed... <br/> “What about my debts..?” <br/> <br/> “What debts?” <br/> <br/> “Y’know the 5 dollars you loaned me that I never gave back?” <br/> “The 5 dollars that warrants a death threat each month?” <br/> <br/> “Oh! I forgot about that!” <br/> “See I signed up for this Death Threat Subscription Service and gave them your address” <br/> “I don’t actually need that 5 dollars anmore, <br/> I stole a bunch of 5 dollars from a bank!” <br/> <br/> you are even more disappointed <br/> “Hey don’t be sad buddy! I actually know who poisioned your drink!” <br/> <br/> you perk up at that. <br/> Finally you shall know who hates you the most <br/> so you can spam their mail with death treats from that Death Threat Subscription Service!! <br/> <br/> But then Fotiá tells you... <br/> <br/> and you can’t belive it!! <br/> <br/> they’re your best friend!! <br/> <br/> no way would they poison you... <br/> <br/> right...?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> Do you trust her? <br/> 1: Yes <br/> 2: No ","After that disapointing conversation with Hav, you decided to find Itazura, your ex <br/><br/><br/> You arrive at Itazura’s secret base. <br/> Which is an abandoned building with his name in bright flashing neon lights. <br/> Quitley cracking open the door you see Itazura... <br/> Playing in a pile of gold... <br/>Gold he stole no doubt but you decide to ask him about it later <br/> You <em> very loudly <em/> open the door. <br/> <br/>Itazura doesn’t notice. <br/>Or he doesn’t care. <br/> <br/> You make your way to the pile of gold <br/> until you are standing right in front of it <br/> <br/>He still doesn’t care <br/> <br/> So you reach down to pick up a small golden coin- <br/> <br/> “Back off!!!” Itazura exclaims, finally acknowledging your own presence <br/> “Ugh.
